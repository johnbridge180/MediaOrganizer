## Request 1

What do you think of this structure for the views?
Did i leave anything out, do you have any suggestions?

Views/
├── ContentView.swift (main grid container)
├── Components/
│   ├── Thumbnail/                                          
│   │   ├── ThumbnailView.swift (renamed from MediaThumbView)
│   │   └── ThumbnailViewModel.swift (renamed from ThumbViewModel)
│   └── PhotoGrid/
│       ├── PhotoGridView.swift (renamed from MediaThumbAsyncGrid.swift)
│       ├── PhotoGridViewModel.swift (renamed from GridViewModel.swift)
│       └── MediaItemsViewModel.swift
├── Tabs/ (corresponds to each of the NavigationLinks in ContentView.swift)
│   ├── Photos/
│   │   └── PhotosView.swift (just a simple view that returns the photogridview as the current navigationlink does)
│   ├── Uploads/
│   │   ├── UploadsView.swift
│   │   └── UploadsViewModel.swift
│   └── Events/
│       └── EventsView.swift (simple view that returns the "Events" text as the current navigationlink does)
└── Windows/ (includes views corresponding to windows and NSPanels)
    ├── MediaDetail/                                               
    │   ├── MediaItemDetailView.swift                              
    │   ├── MediaItemDetailViewModel.swift                         
    │   └── MediaItemDetailWindow.swift 
    ├── DownloadOverlay/
    │   ├── DownloadOverlayView.swift                              
    │   └── DownloadOverlayPanel.swift
    └── Settings/ (keep as-is)

## Request 2

Ok. Answering questions:
1. MediaItemsViewModel is specific to PhotoGrid. leave it there
2. Sure, rename DownloadOverlay to Downloads
3. leave "Settings" as is

Can you print out the FULL folder hierarchy we have proposed, and outline the changes that need to be made, files that need to be added, etc in a step by step plan that you could execute?

## Request 3

I see a few issues here that you need to address. Plan your execution and let me approve it before doing anything.
1. Some filenames now dont match the name of the struct/class inside. These need to be refactored and all references need to be updated
2. The newly created PhotosView/EventsViews need to actually replace what was being used for these tabs in the ContentView. Make sure they mimic exactly what was being passed to the NavigationLinks and update the ContentView.swift to use the new views.
3. Please double check all files to make sure we didn't unnecessarily duplicate code or add complexity that is unnecessary with these changes
